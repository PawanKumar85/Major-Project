## Repository Branch Structure

The repository follows a **branch-based development model** where each member works on a separate branch.

### Branches:

- **`main`**
- **`member/Anamika`**
- **`member/Naitik`**
- **`member/Pawan`**
- **`member/Surendra`**
- **`member/Virat`**
- **`testing`**
- **`Notes`**

---

### Important Guidelines

‚úÖ Stick to your assigned branch.  
‚ùå **Do not switch to others' branches** without permission.

---

## Cloning the Repository

To clone the repository to your local system, run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PawanKumar85/Major-Project.git
```

---

## Managing Branches

### View Branches

- Local branches:

```bash
git branch
```

- Remote branches:

```bash
git branch -r
```

- All branches:

```bash
git branch -a
```

---

## Creating and Switching Branches

Create and switch to a new branch:

```bash
git switch -C <Branch-Name>
```

---

## Development Workflow

### 1. Switch to Your Branch

```bash
git switch <Branch-Name>
```

### 2. Code Implementation

Write your code and test locally.

### 3. Review Changes

View changes before staging:

```bash
git diff
```

### 4. Stage Changes

Add files or folders to staging:

```bash
git add <File-Name>
```

### 5. Review Staged Changes

```bash
git diff --cached
```

### 6. Commit Changes

Commit with a meaningful message:

```bash
git commit -m "Your commit message"
```

### 7. Push Changes

- First-time push:

```bash
git push origin -u <Branch-Name>
```

- Subsequent pushes:

```bash
git push
```

---

## Additional Git Commands

### Undo Staged Changes

Unstage changes without affecting your code:

```bash
git reset
```

### Undo Last Commit (Permanent Reset)

Remove changes and reset your branch to the previous commit:

```bash
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```

---

## More Useful Git Commands

### Check Repository Status

```bash
git status
```

### View Commit History (Condensed)

```bash
git log --oneline
```

### Switch Between Branches

```bash
git switch <branch-name>
```

---

## Merge and Stash Options

### Merge Branches

Combine another branch into your current branch:

```bash
git merge <branch-name>
```

### Stash Uncommitted Changes

Temporarily save your changes:

```bash
git stash
```

### Reapply Stashed Changes

```bash
git stash pop
```
